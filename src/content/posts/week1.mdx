## Assignment

model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project,
compress your images and videos,
and post a description with your design files on your class page

The tolerance of the laser seems to be 49.9 against trying to cut a 50mm square of cardboard.
So it has a difference of 1 mm for the laser.

## Things we need to model

- Case for the motor itself
- Case for the wire holder
- Case for the board that we might use
- Some way to attach the board to the truss and the motor as well

Need to model the wire holder for the motor
