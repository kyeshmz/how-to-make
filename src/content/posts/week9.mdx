I turned my PCB board around because I was using a bunch of headers and I wanted to make sure that I didn't have to think about turning the orientation of the board around, it was just much harder when you needed to think about flipping everything.

The worst thing happened when I was trying to make it work, the flipped board didnt work, but with the same code, the inverse board worked. I deduced that it must be a hardware issue, so I reached out to the TAs who had helped me late in to the hours of the night, showcasing some debugging techiniques, while also bashing on how I wasn't doing the due diligence on some of the ways I was treating my board.

It turns out that my pin numbers were wrong, and I was using the wrong pins, so I had to change them to the correct pins.
I was using the pin number for digital pins, but it turns out that you needed to use the GPIO pins.

There also was a bunch of red flags including:
- wiring my power cables so that they were tidy
- using the correct jumper wires
- using the correct voltage pass through for my stepper driver
- using the correct software setup for my code (actually selecting esp32c6)
- the different pins between esp32c6 and esp32s3
- my powersupply was kind of dying


I finally got it working with me being able to send out OSC through Touchdesigner and being able to receive it through the ESP32 and move the motors.

The motors and the motor driver became exteremely hot, which was another problem but I hope to manage it through heatsinking.

I also made a small power board for my PCB that would be used to add some 12V DC power to my motor board.

# Group project

We looked into Marcello's robots and saw that he was using a dual battery pack to power his robots, and we were ablt to look into how much power he was using. It turns out that the power fluctuated when he was idle, only powering one of the motors, and when he was active, he would power both motors.

The power delivery system was really handy because you could see just how much power was being actually pulled, and I always had this thought that power was something that was being delivered, not pulled.
