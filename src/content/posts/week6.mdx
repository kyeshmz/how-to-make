This week was to make a microdev board.

I used kicad to create my PCB board and it turned out okay!

It turns out that if you dont use the probing of the Carvera that it makes it harder to make the overall probing of the board

I also made a small power board for my PCB that would be used to add some 12V DC power to my motor board.

It turned out to not be that bad, and actually works when I use it on a bread board.
Its much better than having to solder another male pin wire to test it out.

The group assignment was done without me because some complications with the scheduling, but my group did a good job looking at the design rules for the inhouse PCB process. It was especially easy to do because of the Carvera which had a way to switch autotools, making the process for testing out the different tool widths much more easier.

I fixed the gerber2img that quentin built, as alot of creating the board was really configuring with different software.

Before the fix, you need to manual add and flip the colors for the drill holes and such, which was a pain because you had to select your holes, inverse them, etc.

So I added a couple of lines of code that checked if a layer was a drill layer, and just flip colors around!
