# Assignment

group assignment:

- demonstrate and compare the toolchains and development workflows for alternative embedded architectures

individual assignment:

- browse through the data sheet for your microcontroller write a program for a microcontroller to interact (with local input &/or output devices) and communicate (with remote wired or wireless connections), and simulate its operation
- extra credit: test it on a development board
- extra credit: try different languages &/or development environments

## Group Assignment

We basically learned alot about different boards and the different protocols that they use.
AVR 8 and ARM have different protocols for communicating with the microcontroller.

<OptimizedCover src={boards} alt="attiny" />

We also learned about:

JTAG / SWD

- JTAG requires 4 signal lines
- SWD only requires 2 signal lines

AVR 8 / ARM

- The (ATtiny 1,2 series and AVR Dx) are AVR 8
- - which means they are 8-bit microcontrollers, so they take alot of time to process 16-bit instructions
- - so 4 cycles per instruction, rather than 1 cycle for a 16 bit machine! Ours is 64 bit which is pretty good

- UPDI target !(https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/programmers/quentorres/-/raw/main/img/updi.png)

SAMD / RP2040 / ESP32

- The SAMD / RP2040 / ESP32 are ARM architecture boards
- - The SAMD is a native USB devices and is
- - The RP2040 has human readable documentation / does not have built in flash memory
- - RP2040 and ESP32 have enough power to use microPython because they have enough processer power!!
- - The ESP32 has wifi and bluetooth and is probably overkill for alot of the things that we make!
- SWD is an ARM specific protocol designed specifically for micro debugging.

## Personal Project

So what I tried to do was connect the ESP32 to the internet, send some OSC packets, and then use the OSC to control the motors.

The motors are currently using the wokwi-a4988 library and board, but the TAs said that this is something that could be made better and handmade without using it.

Maybe I could look into something like microstepping.

I was working to use OSC with the ESP32 and I found out that it was not possible due to CAPITALISM!!

Noticed that you need a paid account to use anything that uses the internet for the ESP32, which was the whole point of the project.

/* ESP32 HTTP IoT Server Example for Wokwi.com

  https://wokwi.com/projects/320964045035274834

  To test, you need the Wokwi IoT Gateway, as explained here:

  https://docs.wokwi.com/guides/esp32-wifi#the-private-gateway

  Then start the simulation, and open http://localhost:9080
  in another browser tab.

  Note that the IoT Gateway requires a Wokwi Club subscription.

```

Oof.
I then tried to hook it up to use a crystal display, but even that was too much.
Maybe it was wokwi trying to tell me that I was doing too much for my own good.

<OptimizedCover src={long} alt="Compilation too long" />

But that was the end of my project, unable to compile for the love of the game

And for those considering the VSCODE extension, I was not able to get it to work and it really seems like a hot mess with the documentation as well.

The datasheet for the ESP32-S3 is [here](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf)

<OptimizedCover src={datasheet} alt="Datasheet " />

So when they said that we had a bunch of different peripherals, it is alot

This is just a explanation from chatgpt but it was working.

```
GDMA (General Direct Memory Access): Handles memory-to-memory data transfers, freeing up CPU resources by offloading this task.

System Timer: A hardware timer for system-level tasks such as delays, time measurement, and managing interrupts.

General-purpose Timers: These timers can be used by the user for various purposes like timing events, generating signals, and managing time-sensitive tasks.

SD/MMC Host: An interface for connecting SD (Secure Digital) cards and MMC (MultiMediaCards) for external data storage.

Pulse Counter: Used to count external pulse signals, which is useful for tasks like measuring rotations or other repetitive signals.

World Controller: Typically used for managing different security levels or contexts within the chip, isolating certain processes for security.

SPI0/1 and SPI2/3: SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) modules for communication with external devices like sensors, displays, and other peripherals.

USB OTG (On-The-Go): Enables USB communication, allowing the chip to function as both a USB device and a USB host.

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter): A communication interface commonly used for serial communication with other devices.

RMT (Remote Control): This peripheral is typically used for generating or receiving remote control signals like IR signals.

GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output): A set of configurable pins for general input/output operations, used to interact with external components like buttons, LEDs, or sensors.

RTC GPIO: GPIO pins that are connected to the RTC (Real-Time Clock), enabling control of pins even when the main processor is in a low-power state.

DIG ADC (Digital Analog Converter) and RTC ADC: These ADC modules convert analog signals to digital, with the RTC ADC available during low-power operations.

USB Serial/JTAG: Provides a serial interface for USB communication and JTAG debugging capabilities.

eFuse Controller: Manages the internal eFuse memory, which stores critical information like chip configuration and secure boot parameters.

Main System Watchdog Timers: Ensures that the system doesn't get stuck in a malfunctioning state by resetting the processor if it becomes unresponsive.

RTC Watchdog Timer: Works similarly to the main watchdog, but operates at a lower power level and can reset the chip if necessary.

Super Watchdog: Likely an enhanced version of a regular watchdog timer, providing an additional safety layer for critical system operations.

Touch Sensor: Detects changes in capacitance, allowing the ESP32-S3 to detect touch inputs.

I2S (Inter-IC Sound): A communication protocol used to interface with audio devices, allowing for digital audio input/output.

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): A communication protocol for connecting low-speed peripherals like sensors or display controllers.

LED PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): Used to control the brightness of LEDs by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

MCPWM (Motor Control PWM): A specialized PWM controller designed for controlling motors, particularly useful in applications like robotics.

LCD Interface: Provides an interface for connecting and controlling LCD displays.

Camera Interface: Used to connect a camera module, allowing for image capture and video streaming.

Temperature Sensor: Measures the internal temperature of the chip, typically used for monitoring and protection against overheating.

## Other languages

- MicroPython /
- - Needs something like ESP32 or something strong to run it
- CircuitPython
- - Fork of micropython from adafruit
