# Assignment

group assignment:

- demonstrate and compare the toolchains and development workflows for alternative embedded architectures

individual assignment:

- browse through the data sheet for your microcontroller write a program for a microcontroller to interact (with local input &/or output devices) and communicate (with remote wired or wireless connections), and simulate its operation
- extra credit: test it on a development board
- extra credit: try different languages &/or development environments

## Group Assignment

We basically learned alot about different boards and the different protocols that they use.
AVR 8 and ARM have different protocols for communicating with the microcontroller.

We also learned about:

JTAG / SWD

- JTAG requires 4 signal lines
- SWD only requires 2 signal lines

AVR 8 / ARM

- The (ATtiny 1,2 series and AVR Dx) are AVR 8
- - which means they are 8-bit microcontrollers, so they take alot of time to process 16-bit instructions
- - so 4 cycles per instruction, rather than 1 cycle for a 16 bit machine! Ours is 64 bit which is pretty good

- UPDI target !(https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/programmers/quentorres/-/raw/main/img/updi.png)

SAMD / RP2040 / ESP32

- The SAMD / RP2040 / ESP32 are ARM architecture boards
- - The SAMD is a native USB devices and is
- - The RP2040 has human readable documentation / does not have built in flash memory
- - RP2040 and ESP32 have enough power to use microPython because they have enough processer power!!
- - The ESP32 has wifi and bluetooth and is probably overkill for alot of the things that we make!
- SWD is an ARM specific protocol designed specifically for micro debugging.

## Personal Project

https://wokwi.com/projects/409835697200587777

I was working to use OSC with the ESP32 and I found out that it was not possible due to CAPITALISM!!

Noticed that you need a paid account to use anything that uses the internet for the ESP32, which was the whole point of the project.

```

/* ESP32 HTTP IoT Server Example for Wokwi.com

  https://wokwi.com/projects/320964045035274834

  To test, you need the Wokwi IoT Gateway, as explained here:

  https://docs.wokwi.com/guides/esp32-wifi#the-private-gateway

  Then start the simulation, and open http://localhost:9080
  in another browser tab.

  Note that the IoT Gateway requires a Wokwi Club subscription.

Oof.
I then tried to hook it up to use a crystal display, but even that was too much.
Maybe it was wokwi trying to tell me that I was doing too much for my own good.

But that was the end of my project, unable to compile for the love of the game

And for those considering the VSCODE extension, I was not able to get it to work and it really seems like a hot mess with the documentation as well.
