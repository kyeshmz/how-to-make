import CustomVideo from "@components/CustomVideo.astro";

This week was networking week and it turns out that I did this in my previous weeks, where I was able to get a motor to turn using OSC to tell it to go left or right.

The code is still the same as the ones we did in week 9

<CustomVideo src={"/osc.mp4"} />

I took this time to work more on my final project, as it's becoming increasingly clear that I need to work more on it, and the deadline for it is coming insanely fast.

I helped out with the group project of the part, turns out that the HTTP client of the Arduino always expects a backslash for the URL, as well as adding in the port number.

This was done in collab with Cyrus and Jessica, and this was the video of the final group assignment that we did.

The dial from Cyrus's board would communicate via wifi to Jessica's board, that would then light up the LEDs on the board.
