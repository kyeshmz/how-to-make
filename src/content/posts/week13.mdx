import CustomVideo from "@components/CustomVideo.astro";
import OptimizedCover from "@components/OptimizedPicture.astro";
import osc_electron from '../images/week13/osc_electron.jpg';

This week was application week, and I worked on the final project of the group project.
But some of the things I was doing was making a interface for the application to work with the osc of the 

<OptimizedCover src={osc_electron} alt="osc_electron"  />

The goal is to make it into something that can be used by anyone and I really wanted to make sure that it would be avaliable without having to configure things about the network.

Also electron would just make it work anywhere in a bunch of places, so I just neeeded to know how to make it work.

I need to make sure that it works so that it will be able to control 2 pairs at a time.

Most of the UI things are made with P5, with the intent that most of the stuff will be done through the Node side of the app.

The application consists of 

- Node OSC server
- P5 on the frontend
- React on the front end
- tweakpane for configuring the front end UI


I might do some online aspect later down the line, but we will see


You can find the code for the application [here](https://github.com/kyeshmz/how-to-make/tree/main/files/cablegraphy/electron)
