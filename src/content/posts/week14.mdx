This week was wild card week and I worked on large format cutting.
I tried to basically make "inflatable food" but it was much harder than I expected.
It was too hard in the sense that I needed it to be the "right" material.

We also tried the sketch to 3d that quentin was working on, and I tried to make some complex object, cause I knew it was something that I knew that could revolve.

You needed something that would be able to expand well, but also not enough that it would break
