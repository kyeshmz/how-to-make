This week was wild card week and I worked on large format cutting.
I tried to basically make "inflatable food" but it was much harder than I expected.

It was too hard in the sense that I needed it to be the "right" material.

We also tried to make some origmai from fruit rollups, and we wanted to use something that was adhesive so that the sides would stick, but not hard that it would not be able to be cut.

but as soon as you started to fold things, you really needed to be careful as it was really malleable to valley and mountain folds

Kat and I  also tried the sketch to 3d that quentin was working on, and I tried to make some complex object, cause I knew it was something that I knew that could revolve.

You would draw a piece of the object on one side and a silhouette of the object on the other side, and you would take a picture of it.

The picture would then be preproocessed to make it into a 3d object.

But it turns out that because my drawings were not continous, it was hard to make the object. It was also closing in between, which made it harder to make it into a 3d object.
