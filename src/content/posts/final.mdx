For my final project, I am thinking about creating a kinetic robot that is a cable robot

These types of robots are great and I was also thinking that it would tie up well to the theme of 99 fridays this year about carnivals.

A roboticist named Madeline Gannon who has 


This is a good starting point for learning about different types of motors. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/types-of-motors

I wanted to know what the difference was between the 2 modules that seemed to be avaliable to us out of the ESP family, the ESP32-S2 and the ESP32-C3.
[This link](https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/01/12/esp32-s3-esp32-c3-esp8266-modules-comparison/) compared the two differences of the modules and it really came down to the S3 is just a beefier version of the C3

The datasheet seems to be [this](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

It also seems to be like they recommend using the same board manager as the espriff series, maybe it is like that because the software should compile the same but the hardware schematics are different so it would be different if you saw it on Kicad or something.

The kicad files were at the bottom of the page on the [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

It would also be cool to look into how these OSC operated motors work.
