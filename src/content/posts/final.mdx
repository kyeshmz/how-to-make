For my final project, I am thinking about creating a kinetic robot that is a cable robot

These types of robots are great and I was also thinking that it would tie up well to the theme of 99 fridays this year about carnivals.

A roboticist named Madeline Gannon who has working on a similar project called [Koriobots](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots) was using a very expensive setup that cost like just $400 ish just for the motors and also there were no tutorials, so I was wondering if I could make something that would be hopefully little bit more accessible and open source!



### Research about motors


This is a good starting point for learning about different types of motors. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/types-of-motors
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/types-of-motors

I wanted to know what the difference was between the 2 modules that seemed to be avaliable to us out of the ESP family, the ESP32-S2 and the ESP32-C3.
[This link](https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/01/12/esp32-s3-esp32-c3-esp8266-modules-comparison/) compared the two differences of the modules and it really came down to the S3 is just a beefier version of the C3

The datasheet seems to be [this](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

It also seems to be like they recommend using the same board manager as the espriff series, maybe it is like that because the software should compile the same but the hardware schematics are different so it would be different if you saw it on Kicad or something.

The kicad files were at the bottom of the page on the [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

It would also be cool to look into how these OSC operated motors work.

### Motor controllers

Kanta Horio made these [Step400](https://ponoor.com/en/products/step400/) boards that take in OSC messages and control the motors.

100 Base TX  vs 100BASE-T
```plaintext 100BASE-T is a way to describe the family of physical layers (or PHYs) that can be used to support 100 Mb/s baseband networks. This family of PHYs includes: 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-T4 and 100BASE-T2. Because 100BASE-T2 and 100BASE-T4 failed to gain market adoption, many adopted the term 100BASE-T to imply the use of the 100BASE-TX PHY; thereby, making the terms synonymous

I talked with Nick on how I should proceed with my device, but it seemed like it was more about knowing what I was going to hang on my wire robots. If it was something that would be light and don't really need alot of torque, I would not have to use something with alot of torque.


The basics seems like there are a few paths that I can take

Stepper motors
+ easy to manipulate
+ pretty cheap
+ can be controlled using a driver
- can slip 
- can be noisy
- you need to send how much steps you need to take each time


Servo motors
+ more torque and being able to know what the positing is
+ anti slippage, as it will do the feedback
+ inexpensive
- if they are position rotation servos, they are limited by their degrees of motion
- needs calibration and calibration is hard. calibration shouldn't be done by ourselves.
- relatively harder to manipulate the exact postiioning, as your sending current rather than stepper positions

DC Motors 
+ quiet 
+ effecient and can achieve max torque
+ some require much less mantinence because they dont have brushes (brushless dc motors)
- harder to manipulate the exact postiioning

I made my design for the new TMC2209 Stepstick stepper driver and I made 2 for them

It doesnt seem to all have turned out quite what I wanted it to be


Things I need to figure out:
- I have 2 motors, how do I move it in a xy plane so that they both are moving something in the center at the same time
- what am I gonna put into the center?
- how do I make sure that I have time to mass produce these things?
- if I were to make some light ring thing, how could I do that and make sure that it works on pico?
- I don't know how to design the wire part



Mid term review comments
try to redesign using nema 17
dont use grooves for now
make a basic ass mount 
figure out mounting mechanism
make whatever we are putting up heavy
try to use one big board instead of breaking it out


Thur Nov 21
I need to make a spool, I have the design like this one but after printing it it seems that I need to add a screw that attaches to the shaft better
https://www.printables.com/model/560628-nema-17-spool/files

if you provide 5v as a power source, you need all the data lines to be 5v too
but 3.3v is standard from esp32

diag for stalling without switches


uart needs to be connected to rx
change to be uart
uart needs to be rx
tx needs to be protected by 
4.73 or 10k

I made the designs for the modular type board that I would make, but it kinda failed because I didn't account for the PCB for the 

Here were the designs that I made

<OptimizedCover src={pico_devboard_11_27_pcb} alt="pico_devboard_11_27_pcb"  /> 

It turns out that the PCB didn't have enough clearance for the stepper drivers, but everything else for the integration seemed fine

 What does it do?
         Who's done what beforehand?
         What sources did you use?
         What did you design?
         What materials and components were used?
         Where did they come from?
         How much did they cost?
         What parts and systems were made?
         What tools and processes were used?
         What questions were answered?
         What worked? What didn't?
         How was it evaluated?
         What are the implications?
      Prepare a summary slide and a one minute video showing its
         conception, construction, and operation
      Your project should incorporate 2D and 3D design,
         additive and subtractive fabrication processes,
         electronics design and production,
         embedded microcontroller design, interfacing, and programming,
         system integration and packaging
      Where possible, you should make rather than buy
         the parts of your project
      Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual 
         mastery of the skills, and be independently operable 
   Present your final project, weekly and group assignments, and documentation
