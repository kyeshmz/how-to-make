For my final project, I am thinking about creating a kinetic robot that is a cable robot

This is from the art group called artcom

These types of robots are great and I was also thinking that it would tie up well to the theme of 99 fridays this year about carnivals.

A roboticist named Madeline Gannon who has working on a similar project called [Koriobots](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots) was using a very expensive setup that cost like just $400 ish just for the motors and also there were no tutorials, so I was wondering if I could make something that would be hopefully little bit more accessible and open source!



### Research about motors


This is a good starting point for learning about different types of motors. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/types-of-motors
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/types-of-motors

I wanted to know what the difference was between the 2 modules that seemed to be avaliable to us out of the ESP family, the ESP32-S2 and the ESP32-C3.
[This link](https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/01/12/esp32-s3-esp32-c3-esp8266-modules-comparison/) compared the two differences of the modules and it really came down to the S3 is just a beefier version of the C3

The datasheet seems to be [this](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

It also seems to be like they recommend using the same board manager as the espriff series, maybe it is like that because the software should compile the same but the hardware schematics are different so it would be different if you saw it on Kicad or something.

The kicad files were at the bottom of the page on the [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

It would also be cool to look into how these OSC operated motors work.

### Motor controllers

Kanta Horio made these [Step400](https://ponoor.com/en/products/step400/) boards that take in OSC messages and control the motors.

100 Base TX  vs 100BASE-T
```plaintext 100BASE-T is a way to describe the family of physical layers (or PHYs) that can be used to support 100 Mb/s baseband networks. This family of PHYs includes: 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-T4 and 100BASE-T2. Because 100BASE-T2 and 100BASE-T4 failed to gain market adoption, many adopted the term 100BASE-T to imply the use of the 100BASE-TX PHY; thereby, making the terms synonymous

I talked with Nick on how I should proceed with my device, but it seemed like it was more about knowing what I was going to hang on my wire robots. If it was something that would be light and don't really need alot of torque, I would not have to use something with alot of torque.


The basics seems like there are a few paths that I can take

Stepper motors
+ easy to manipulate
+ pretty cheap
+ can be controlled using a driver
- can slip 
- can be noisy
- you need to send how much steps you need to take each time


Servo motors
- relatively harder to manipulate the exact postiioning, as your sending current rather than stepper positions

DC Motors 
+ quiet 
+ effecient and can achieve max torque
+ some require much less mantinence because they dont have brushes (brushless dc motors)
- harder to manipulate the exact postiioning
