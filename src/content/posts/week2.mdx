## Laser Cutter

### Group Assignment

This was the final

### Personal Assignment

For the personal assignment, I wanted to create a Noguchi Lamp, which is a lamp made by [Isamu Noguchi](https://www.noguchi.org/isamu-noguchi/biography/biography/).

I wanted to first make the lamp, but I was suprised at how Fusion360 was really manual, compared to the algorithmic wonder that is Rhino and Grasshopper. But I wanted to learn something new, so I decided to use Fusion360.

While creating the initial design of the lamp, I was making mistakes left and right, with only a few days left to make everything.

Then I remembered,

Maybe it might be better to just start small, or simple that I knew that I could make and go from there. So that led me to really start small and try to build up from there.

So really, the first thing I did was just sketch out the schematics of how big I wanted everything to be on really plain paper.
It wasn't really the prettiest thing, but it was a good start.

Then, I could build up from there.

So then I modeled my inital design, and started to use the laser cutter.

This is where the kerf tests from before came in handy.
I was able to get the laser cutter to cut out my designs, while still upholding the structure of the lamp!

The several other things I wanted to do with the lamp looked like this:

1. Lock down what kind of bulb I could stick into it (or really where to find something that would work)
2. Make it more organic looking
3. Put on some living hinge shades!

## Vinyl Cutter

The goal was to make a sticker that looked a bit like Johnny because he was so helpful during the laser cutting process and sharing his MechE knowledge with us.

But because the photo was too high res, and it would take days to cut it out and place it on something, we had to find out a way to make it lower res.

I used a tool called [cutecutter](https://cutecutter.com/make-a-vinyl-decal/)
, which was honestly amazing as it was very easy to use and had easy options to lower the resolution of the image.

It then gave me some parameters to play with, and I was able to get it to down to the right amount of abstraction that I needed. I wish it really just made all the parts into one part so that taking off of the cutter would be easier, but alas no.

Cutting it out was a bit of a pain, but it went out better than I expected.
Note to myself in the future: Strong stick on the cutter really makes sure that it is strong stick!

I also helped a few people out with their logos. I used a tool called [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/) for my friends who had white and black logos (which were mostly really MIT Media Lab logos), and it made it so that only the black part of the logo was left, which was perfect for the logo.

### Memo

The tolerance of the laser seems to be 49.9 against trying to cut a 50mm square of cardboard.
So it has a difference of 1 mm for the laser.

0.2 offset for the kerf for 4mm cardboard
