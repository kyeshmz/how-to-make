## Laser Cutter

### Group Assignment

## Vinyl Cutter

The goal was to make a sticker that looked a bit like Johnny because he was so helpful during the laser cutting process and sharing his MechE knowledge with us.

But because the photo was too high res, and it would take days to cut it out and place it on something, we had to find out a way to make it lower res.

I used a tool called [cutecutter](https://cutecutter.com/make-a-vinyl-decal/)
, which was honestly amazing as it was very easy to use and had easy options to lower the resolution of the image.

It then gave me some parameters to play with, and I was able to get it to down to the right amount of abstraction that I needed. I wish it really just made all the parts into one part so that taking off of the cutter would be easier, but alas no.

Cutting it out was a bit of a pain, but it went out better than I expected.
Note to myself in the future: Strong stick on the cutter really makes sure that it is strong stick!

I also helped a few people out with their logos. I used a tool called [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/) for my friends who had white and black logos (which were mostly really MIT Media Lab logos), and it made it so that only the black part of the logo was left, which was perfect for the logo.

The tolerance of the laser seems to be 49.9 against trying to cut a 50mm square of cardboard.
So it has a difference of 1 mm for the laser.

2 for the kerf for 4mm cardboard
