This week was to make a dev board.

I originally wanted to make some sort of POE or Ethernet adapter for my ESP32 because connecting Wifi all the time to it might be a pain in the future.

Talking to some of the TA's, it became apparent that PoE was not the way because of the many loop holes that I would have to go through to make Ethernet work and also the obligations that I would have to do for negotiating what kind of power output I would need.

So here is my initial board, 







As I am looking for my i




Micro stepping isnt really needed for long strides
Micro stepping is in theroy the sine wave of the electric slots

DC motor can get more speed and can attach encoder 
stepper motor good because you know which accuracy it has

stepper is convinent, 
dc motors dump current in and 
servo motor is dc motor with an encoder and where tell it where its in the right place


Stepper driver will do the "stepping " for you



what is a transistor


DC has to do before 
Stepper before

Step point
h bridge for stepper is more accurate because you know the direction 
bottlenecked because you have to send it som nay times


modular things stepper hbridge xiao
