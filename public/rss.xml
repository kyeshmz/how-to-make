## Assignment

model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project,
compress your images and videos,
and post a description with your design files on your class page

The tolerance of the laser seems to be 49.9 against trying to cut a 50mm square of cardboard.
So it has a difference of 1 mm for the laser.

2 for the kerf for 4mm cardboard

## Assignment

group assignment:

- do your lab&apos;s safety training
- characterize your lasercutter&apos;s focus, power, speed, rate,
- - kerf, joint clearance and types

individual assignment:

- cut something on the vinylcutter
- design, lasercut, and document a parametric construction kit, accounting for the lasercutter kerf, which can be assembled in multiple ways, and for extra credit include elements that aren&apos;t flat

## Laser Cutter

### Group Assignment

This was the final

&lt;OptimizedCover
  src={finalkerf}
  alt=&quot;Final parts from all of the experimentation&quot;
/&gt;

### Personal Assignment

For the personal assignment, I wanted to create a Noguchi Lamp, which is a lamp made by [Isamu Noguchi](https://www.noguchi.org/isamu-noguchi/biography/biography/).

&lt;iframe
  width=&quot;560&quot;

  referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot;
  allowfullscreen
&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

I wanted to first make the lamp, but I was suprised at how Fusion360 was really manual, compared to the algorithmic wonder that is Rhino and Grasshopper. But I wanted to learn something new, so I decided to use Fusion360.

While creating the initial design of the lamp, I was making mistakes left and right, with only a few days left to make everything.

Then I remembered,

&lt;iframe

  src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tV6nzcfG2CA?si=2k-tXfKvojz1T3yK&quot;

  referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot;
  allowfullscreen
&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Maybe it might be better to just start small, or simple that I knew that I could make and go from there. So that led me to really start small and try to build up from there.

So really, the first thing I did was just sketch out the schematics of how big I wanted everything to be on really plain paper.
It wasn&apos;t really the prettiest thing, but it was a good start.

&lt;OptimizedCover src={paper} alt=&quot;paper&quot; /&gt;

Then, I could build up from there.

So then I modeled my inital design, and started to use the laser cutter.

This is where the kerf tests from before came in handy.
I was able to get the laser cutter to cut out my designs, while still upholding the structure of the lamp!

&lt;OptimizedCover src={prototype1} alt=&quot;prototype1&quot; /&gt;

There was some failures because of the document position

&lt;OptimizedCover src={failure} alt=&quot;failure&quot; /&gt;

The several other things I wanted to do with the lamp looked like this:

1. Lock down what kind of bulb I could stick into it (or really where to find something that would work)
2. Make it more organic looking
3. Put on some living hinge shades!

Updates:

I went to the office hour of the class, and was asking the TA technical questions about the living hinges (I couldn&apos;t find good literature about how to make them algorithmically, or if there was a good way to do it).

His answer was that you shouldnt be thinking too hard about it and it would be better to just test out and try.

frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;
class=&quot;giphy-embed flex justify-center w-full&quot;
allowFullScreen

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

And that I did.

My woes were not done as I found out that the curvature of the cardboard was too much, and really messed with the accuracy of the laser cutting.
It would just make everything slowly not cut and curve out!! So, I had to make things work more manually.

&lt;OptimizedCover src={woes} alt=&quot;Woes&quot; /&gt;
&lt;OptimizedCover src={madness} alt=&quot;madness&quot; /&gt;

Hopefully, I decided to make it manually, and put some weight on the cardboard to help it stay in place. Double checked with the laser that it would not hit it, and checked its pathing so that it wouldnt collide.

&lt;OptimizedCover src={weight} alt=&quot;weight&quot; /&gt;

## Vinyl Cutter

The goal was to make a sticker that looked a bit like Johnny because he was so helpful during the laser cutting process and sharing his MechE knowledge with us.

&lt;OptimizedCover src={Johnny} alt=&quot;Johnny&quot; /&gt;

But because the photo was too high res, and it would take days to cut it out and place it on something, we had to find out a way to make it lower res.

I used a tool called [cutecutter](https://cutecutter.com/make-a-vinyl-decal/)
, which was honestly amazing as it was very easy to use and had easy options to lower the resolution of the image.

&lt;OptimizedCover src={cutecutter} alt=&quot;Johnny being segemented&quot; /&gt;

It then gave me some parameters to play with, and I was able to get it to down to the right amount of abstraction that I needed. I wish it really just made all the parts into one part so that taking off of the cutter would be easier, but alas no.

&lt;OptimizedCover src={cutecutter2} alt=&quot;Cutecutter parameters&quot; /&gt;

Cutting it out was a bit of a pain, but it went out better than I expected.
Note to myself in the future: Strong stick on the cutter really makes sure that it is strong stick!

&lt;OptimizedCover src={grip} alt=&quot;Helping out others&quot; /&gt;

&lt;OptimizedCover src={finaljohnny} alt=&quot;Cutecutter parameters&quot; /&gt;

I also helped a few people out with their logos. I used a tool called [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/) for my friends who had white and black logos (which were mostly really MIT Media Lab logos), and it made it so that only the black part of the logo was left, which was perfect for the logo.

### Memo

The tolerance of the laser seems to be 49.9 against trying to cut a 50mm square of cardboard.
So it has a difference of 1 mm for the laser.
